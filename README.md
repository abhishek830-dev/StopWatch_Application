## ⚙️ How It Works

The stopwatch uses JavaScript's **setInterval()** function to update the timer every **10 milliseconds**.

* **Start Button** → Begins the timer
* **Stop Button** → Pauses the timer
* **Reset Button** → Clears the timer and sets it back to `00 : 00 : 00`

The application updates the DOM dynamically to display the current time.
